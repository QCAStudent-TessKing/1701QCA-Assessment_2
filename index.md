This DIY journal and guide is the main inspiration and technical research I've found. In it, the author describes their process for creating this MIDI controller for their synthesizers. He delves into the technical aspect of realising his ideation. In particular, providing schematics of his electronic setup and coding. He is also honest about the difficulties he had along the way, as well as the outcome. 

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###

As a general and condensed statement: 

*To explore breath as expression*

### Design concept 1 ###
#### A Creative Tool or Installation for Abstract Art ####

This would be an interactive art piece in which there is a large canvas and one or more tubes (with mouth-pieces) which connected to the canvas frame. Viewers would be encouraged to blow into the mouthpieces. This action would result in changes in what would appear on this canvas, depending on the length, interval and intensity of breath. Which would result in the formation of blobs varying in size, shape and colour corresponding to those variables. This would be similar to how Suminagashi (see here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwaLFLbqJQg for an example) looks. An idea for technical execution was to either utilise a pre-existing screen or create once out of a matrix of strip LEDs or similar. 

There was a variation of this concept that I had. Instead of mouthpieces and tubes, viewers would blow directly onto the "canvas". Technically, this could be achieved with sensors hidden in areas of the screen (far more suitable to the second fabrication concept) which measured the breath.


Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###
#### The Calm-Down Friend ####

This idea realises the intent by giving users a means to consider their breath more intently. It would be a compact box or similar object which the user breathes into. From there, the box will tell the user if they should slow their breathing down, deepen their breath or hold it for longer. This is intended to assist people in meditative practices and anxiety control methods. The interaction with the user would be some light and sound feedback. It could be sampled speech or ambient music which changes as your breath slows and portrays a calmer nature.

### Final design concept ###
#### Aeolus ####

This is a product which is designed for users to better understand the expressivity of breath through predominately musical feedback. It is designed around affordances and mappings of acoustic wind instruments. The sound generated is of a lower concern than the interactions which produce them. These interactions are focused around the breath and the gestures it contributes to in other areas of the body. The interactions capable with Aeolus are: breathing into the mouthpiece, holding it (preferably at the hand holds) and moving it (preferably from a central pivoting point at the mouth). This simplistic interaction model is designed with the intent that as users experiment more with the instrument, they naturally grow more aware of the movement of the entire body due to the breath and the subtleties which drastically change the sound. Or more simply: to draw attention to the expressivity of breath through sound expression. While the sound generation is a vast world of expression and feedback for the user, I felt that adding visual responses added personability to the instrument itself. Being an instrument which is an extension of the human body, this personability will aid viewers experience a deeper expression from the performer. 

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Design process discussion ##

At the beginning of this journey, I fortunately (but perhaps unintentionally) followed the double diamond methodology by researching and discussing expression through the body. In my field, it is a fascinating subject which tends to focus on the relationship between expression physically through the body but also through the extension thereof into the instrument. The way in which a performer will arguably "unnecessarily" move whilst performing. I didn't have a specific area of interest at the beginning as suggested in the double diamond method (DDM) but a range of specific interests which conglomerate into a confusing mass of questions and theories.

As I started to implement the DDM, I found that it was difficult for me to find the specific "problem" which I was discovering and eventually defining. Even now, I occassionally get sidetracked by something interesting or some doubt about the problem itself. To help get out of this rut, the best assistance was input from others. I would present some iterations of problems and get wonderful input from a completely new perspective.

This assistance really helped push me along the route of definition in the first diamond. This, for me, was perhaps the most difficult aspect because it required me to make concrete decisions right there. Again, there were moments where I lost track of where my focus was, but that outside input assisted in making those decisions. Another method for getting to that point of focus  and definition was a kind of 'backwards ideation flow chart'. Because I was so intent on the product I used this method to deconstruct my own concepts to topics, issues and definitions. It involves taking concept/s in mind (that is, if you're similar in that you couldn't wait to think of what you would make) and summarising them in the most efficient means possible, the more descriptive words the better. Then you take those descriptive words of the summary and define what they mean in and out of context. If there are any discrepancies for you, then it may not be the specific product or qualities you find interesting, but the interactions or means to qualities. To put this into context, here was my own process:

Original Concept for Product, *A digital musical instrument which is controlled by breath and movement.*

Taking the words apart I found that key words such as:*digital, musical instrument, breath and movement,* weren't my deepest interests at all. I was more intrigued by results it would have. Here those results were new performative gestures. While I was being specific about what kind of gestures even they didn't describe the larger result. This was expression. I was really interested in expression! 

That was progress enough.

Following the DDM from that point of realisation onward has been far easier. Potential solutions were popping up rapidly after clearly understanding my own interest. The solution that I landed on was still related to my original idea, but had far more intent and clarity about its design and purpose. This clarity is why I have chosen the interactions and methods of feedback that I have.

The afore mentioned modes of feedback must react in specific ways to cement the rules of that personability and make the relationship between performer, instrument and result much more discoverable. For example, the light feedback has an element of flashing which is observed to be related to tremolo rate (rate of volume pulsing) and the flashing increases in frequency as the tremolo rate decreases. This example goes against the user's expectations and confuses that sense of ease and discoverability. This kind of mentality is being applied to all areas of interaction throughout the implementation of the double diamond method. 

The area of fabrication is the least known area at my current stage of prototyping. I have done some testing (as you will see later on) but am ultimately still undecided on a clear direction. My original aesthetic choice was of a smooth, carved wooden feel, with areas of frosted acrylic for the light to bleed through. With current restrictions, I am considering focusing on cardboard as the main material for construction with decorating in some fashion to move away from the "raw" cardboard aesthetic. In this I have found some issues relating to that method of fabrication. Namely that it is fragile, imperfect and very difficult to 'piece together' using the materials available to me (PVA glue, masking tape, electrical tape and blutak). Which ultimately makes the concept of it being a self-contained instrument which can accessed and put back together with ease a tad more tricky.

The approach to materials I originally had was to attempt to utilise what equipment I had on hand. Since testing with those materials, I decided that I wanted to outsource some of the materials for consistency, reliability and ease of function. Namely the technical sensor materials and potentially microcontroller changes. With the potential microcontroller change also comes the change to coding approach, mentality and outcome. For better or worse these decisions need to be made. 

## Next steps ##
My plans in the next coming 4 weeks are to continue testing various materials and electronic fabrications. For me personally, I find it better to simultaneously test design, fabrication materials and methods and technical achievements so that I do not try and fit any area to one set idea, but allow the product to form as a result of findings and discoveries.
