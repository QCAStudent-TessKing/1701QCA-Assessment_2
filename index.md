# 1701QCA Making Interaction - Assessment 2 workbook

You will use this workbook to keep track of your progress through the course and also as a process journal to document the making of your projects. The comments in italics throughout the template give suggestions about what to include. Feel free to delete those instructions when you have completed the sections.

When you have completed the template, submit the link to the GitHub Pages site for this repository as a link in Learning@Griffith. The link should be something like [https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/](https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/) where `qcainteractivemedia` is replaced with your GitHub username and `1701QCA-Assessment2` is replaced with whatever you called the repository this template is contained in when you set it up.

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*To explore breath as expression.*

### Design concept 1 ###
*A Creative Tool for Abstract Art*

This would be an interactive art piece in which there is a large canvas and one or more tubes (with mouth-pieces) which connected to the canvas frame. Viewers would be encouraged to blow into the mouthpieces. This action would result in changes in what would appear on this canvas, depending on the length, interval and intensity of breath. Which would result in the formation of blobs varying in size, shape and colour corresponding to those variables. This would be similar to how Suminagashi (see here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwaLFLbqJQg for an example) looks. 


Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###
*Put details here.*

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
